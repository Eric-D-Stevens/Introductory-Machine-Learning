# Simple Linear Regression 

This project is a very simple demonstration  of the application of linear regression 
to real estate data in order to predict real estate value. The method is applied to 
the Carnegie Mellon Boston housing dataset. The data and the infomation about the
features can be found [here]( http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston).

## Usage

This project relies on Python 3.6. The only library that needs to be installed to 
run this script is the NumPy library. The data is included in the repository. This 
data could be replaced by another dataset with the same number of features and run
 properly. 

### Prerequisites

To run this script you will need Python 3 and NumPy
 system or using it for a little demo

## Running and Output 

### Running

To run this file, get into the 'Linear_Regression' directory and enter

```
Python3 HousingPriceRegression.py
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
